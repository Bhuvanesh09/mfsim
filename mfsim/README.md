Mutual Fund Rebalancing Backtester - Design Document

1. Introduction
This document outlines the design for a Python package aimed at backtesting rebalancing strategies for mutual funds in India. Utilizing historical NAV data, the package allows users to simulate and evaluate various rebalancing strategies over extended periods.

2. Functional Requirements
Custom Strategy Implementation

Users can define custom strategies by subclassing the BaseStrategy class.
Strategies must specify rebalancing frequency and required metrics.
Access to necessary data parameters (e.g., current portfolio, market performance).
Metrics Tracking

Comprehensive tracking of performance and risk metrics (e.g., total return, Sharpe ratio).
Modular metrics system to allow easy addition of new metrics.
Configurable Rebalancing Frequency

Users can set rebalancing intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) as configurable parameters.
3. Data Handling
Data Structure

Fund List: Single CSV containing all mutual fund names.
NAV Data: Directory of CSV files, each named after a fund, containing date and NAV columns.
Data Access

Local storage assumed for all datasets.
Efficient loading mechanisms to read and process CSV files as needed.

Detailed Design Explanation
1. Introduction
The Mutual Fund Rebalancing Backtester is a Python-based tool designed to help investors and analysts evaluate the effectiveness of various mutual fund rebalancing strategies over historical data. By simulating different rebalancing frequencies and strategies, users can gain insights into potential portfolio performance and risk profiles.

2. Functional Requirements
Custom Strategy Implementation
To provide flexibility, the package allows users to define their own rebalancing strategies. This is achieved by creating classes that inherit from a BaseStrategy abstract class. Each strategy must specify:

Rebalancing Frequency: Determines how often the portfolio is rebalanced (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
Metrics to Track: Specifies which performance and risk metrics to calculate.
Data Parameters: Access to current portfolio holdings, market performance indicators, etc.
Metrics Tracking
A modular approach is adopted for metrics tracking. All metrics are defined in a separate metrics module, allowing easy addition or modification. This ensures that the backtester can evolve to include new performance indicators without altering the core system.

Configurable Rebalancing Frequency
Users can set the rebalancing frequency through configuration parameters when initializing their strategy or the simulator. This configurability ensures that the tool can adapt to various investment styles and preferences.

3. Data Handling
Data Structure
Fund List CSV: Contains a list of all mutual funds available for backtesting.
NAV Data CSVs: Each mutual fund has its own CSV file containing daily NAV data with date and NAV columns.
Data Access
Data is assumed to be stored locally for simplicity. The data_loader.py utility handles reading the fund list and individual NAV files, ensuring efficient access during simulations. Given the manageable data scale, performance optimizations focus on reading and processing data quickly without the need for advanced storage solutions.

4. Technical Architecture
Package Structure
The package is organized into clear, modular directories:

strategies/: Contains the base and custom strategy classes.
metrics/: Houses metric definitions and aggregation logic.
backtester/: Includes the simulator responsible for running backtests.
utils/: Utility scripts for data loading and logging.
logs/: Stores log files detailing simulation runs.
tests/: Placeholder for future testing scripts.
Root Files: README.md for documentation, setup.py for packaging, and requirements.txt for dependencies.
Core Components
Strategies Module: Facilitates the creation and management of different rebalancing strategies.
Metrics Module: Centralizes metric calculations, ensuring consistency and ease of extension.
Backtester Module: Manages the simulation lifecycle, from initializing portfolios to executing rebalancing actions based on strategies.
Utils Module: Provides supporting functions like data loading from CSV files and logging simulation events.
Dependencies
The package relies on widely-used Python libraries to ensure reliability and ease of maintenance:

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
Logging Module: For recording simulation events and debugging.
5. Backtesting Engine
Simulator Class
The Simulator class is the heart of the backtesting engine. It orchestrates the simulation by:

Initialization: Accepting user inputs such as the simulation period, initial investment type (lumpsum or SIP), and the chosen strategy.
Data Preparation: Loading necessary NAV data and preparing the initial portfolio.
Simulation Loop: Iterating through each date in the simulation period, executing rebalancing actions as dictated by the strategy.
Metrics Calculation: Recording performance and risk metrics at each step.
Result Compilation: Aggregating all metrics and returning them to the user upon completion.
Assumptions
For the initial version, the simulator simplifies the model by ignoring brokerage fees, taxes, and slippage. This allows for a focus on strategy effectiveness without the complexities of transaction costs.

6. Data Visualization and Reporting
While visualization is deferred for future versions, the package ensures comprehensive logging of all simulation activities. Logs provide a transparent record of:

Rebalancing Events: Dates and actions taken during rebalancing.
Portfolio Changes: Updates to holdings and allocations.
Metric Updates: Calculations of performance and risk metrics over time.
These logs serve as a foundation for future reporting and visualization features.

7. Future Considerations
Scalability Enhancements
As the tool matures, support for larger datasets and additional asset classes (e.g., ETFs, stocks) can be integrated. This would require optimizing data handling and potentially introducing more sophisticated storage solutions.

Feature Extensions
Future iterations may include:

Transaction Costs Modeling: Incorporating brokerage fees and taxes into simulations.
Slippage Impact: Accounting for the effect of trade sizes on execution prices.
Visualization Tools: Adding charts and graphs for better result interpretation.
User Interface Improvements: Developing a more user-friendly API and possibly a graphical interface.
